Feel the edges of the furniture if you're getting veneer. The veneer should<br> be so tightly fused to the substrate that you can't feel a difference. Look for pieces where the veneer is used on the larger areas such as the top and sides. The veneer grain, color <br>matching, and overall effect should look good. Veneering is NOT an indication of lower quality, but instead should be assessed for its craftsmanship.</b><br></h2>
